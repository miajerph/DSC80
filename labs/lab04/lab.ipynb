    "Welcome to the fourth DSC 80 lab this quarter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Unlike in DSC 10, labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2024-sp).\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To ensure that all of the work you want to submit is in `lab.py`, we've included a script named `lab-validation.py` in the lab folder. You shouldn't edit it, but instead, you should call it from the command line (e.g. the Terminal) to test your work.** More details on its usage are given at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing code from `lab.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below, we import the `.py` file that's contained in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "* We use the `autoreload` notebook extension to make changes to our `lab.py` file immediately available in our notebook. Without this extension, we would need to restart the notebook kernel to see any changes to `lab.py` in the notebook.\n",
    "    - `autoreload` is necessary because, upon import, `lab.py` is compiled to bytecode (in the directory `__pycache__`). Subsequent imports of `lab` merely import the existing compiled python."

You take your car to an empty Vons parking lot, speed up to exactly 60 MPH, hit the brakes, and measure the stopping distance. As illegal as it is, you repeat this process 50 times and find that **you stopped in under 106 feet only 47 of the 50 times**.\n",
